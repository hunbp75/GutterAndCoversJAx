      <p className="faqs-title">Why Does My House Need Gutters ?</p>
      <p className="faqs-text">
        To prevent stains or damage on your stone, brick or siding, and to
        prevent expensive landscaping washing away in the rain. Foundation
        damage results in your home settling, causing additional damage in the
        way of cracked walls, floors and ceilings, and uneven doors. Investing a
        relatively small amount now can prevent large expenses in the future.

      <p className="faqs-title">What is meant by the term "seamless" ?</p>
      <p className="faqs-text">
        From endcap to endcap or corner to corner is one section of gutter vs.
        gutters which come in 10' sections and must be pieced together. Gutters
        are run out of an extruding machine in one continuous length, on site,
        to any length necessary for a particular building. The only exception
        would be the necessity of an expansion joint on extremely long sections
        of gutter.

      <p className="faqs-title">What size gutters do I need ?</p>
      <div className="faqs-text">
        <p>Gutters are sized according to the roof size.</p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          6'' K-style gutters are used for residential homes and sometimes
          commercial buildings, with a collection opening of 5.25'' and a
          capacity of 4 quarts of water per foot. Combined with 3x4 inch
          downspouts described below, 6'' gutters will ensure maximum
          performance.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          Industry standards recommend a 3x4 inch downspout for a 1,200 sq. ft.
          roof, and 4x5 inch downspout for a 2000 sq. ft. roof. The typical
          downspout size for a 6'' K-style gutter is 3x4 inches.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          Hard surface roofing materials, such as slate, tile and metal require
          wider gutter. On steeply-pitched roofs wider gutters are needed to
          keep the water from shooting over the gutter in a heavy rain. In cases
          like this we recommend the use of 7'' gutters with 4x5 inch
          downspouts!
        </p>

      <p className="faqs-title">What is the difference in aluminum gauges ?</p>
      <p className="faqs-text">
        Do-it-yourself stores often sell .019 or .025 gauge, which is too light
        for gutters. Medium weight .027 gauge coil is considered the industry
        standard, builder-grade gutter, and heavy weight .032 gauge aluminum is
        used for larger gutters, heavy wind areas, extremely long gutter runs,
        mostly in commercial applications, and other times when maximum strength
        is needed.
      </p>

      <p className="faqs-title">
        Why would I choose a Half Round Gutter System ?
      </p>
      <p className="faqs-text">
        This style is a matter of personal choice - historic areas sometimes
        require half round and some architects incorporate this style into their
        plans for aesthetics.
      </p>

      <p className="faqs-title">
        Why are gutters hung with a slope vs. straight across ?
      </p>
      <p className="faqs-text">
        Gutters need a minimum slope of 1/2 inch for every 40 continuous feet in
        order for water to reach the downspout properly.
      </p>

      <p className="faqs-title">
        What is galvanic corrosion and how can it be prevented?
      </p>
      <p className="faqs-text">
        When two different metals are in contact in the presence of moisture,
        the stronger metal will cause the weaker metal to corrode. Contact
        between dissimilar metals should always be avoided, including wash from
        one to another.
      </p>

      <p className="faqs-title">What about vinyl gutter ?</p>
      <p className="faqs-text">
        UV rays deteriorate vinyl gutter causing discoloration, cracking,
        expansion & contraction, and general deterioration.
