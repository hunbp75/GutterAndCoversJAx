      <p className="text-gutter">
        Description: 6" seamless ogee or k-style aluminum gutter has been the
        industry standard for over 40 years. This is the product preferred by
        architects, builders and homeowners across the country and it is the
        recommended size gutter for the occasional torrential rain in Florida.
        We manufacture all 6" seamless gutter on site, custom made for your home
        or building, eliminating any joints or seams. We use .027 or .032
        aluminum with baked on enamel finish that comes with a twenty year
        warranty. We use a .060 hidden hangers at every 36 inches. We use the
        very best sealant available to ensure leak free endcaps and miters. Most
        6" installation utilizes our 3"X4" downspout. Our standard downspout and
        elbow is manufactured from prepainted .019 aluminum. We install the
        downspouts with two wrap around straps on one story and another strap at
        the joints on 2 and 3 story installations. Our installations carry a 15
        year labor and 20 year material manufacturer warranty.

        can use brass or stainless steel hidden hangers when installing 16 ounce
        copper gutter. We can install 6" seamless copper gutter with 3x4
        downspouts or 3", 4" round downspouts and scupper heads or commonly
        known as collector boxes.
